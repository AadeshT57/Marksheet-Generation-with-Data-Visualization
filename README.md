# Hello there! If you are looking for a project which is related to generation of marksheet using Python, then you are on the right page.
# This project contains following:
# Project code
# Project images
# This project work focuses on problem that is faced by schools, colleges, institutions which are present and increasing each day. So, it has become difficult to generate the marksheet of each student within the prescribed time.
# The project is made using the different modules, packages and libraries of Python Programming Language.
# To overcome this problem, I have taken a step to build a Marksheet generation system which will generate the mark card of each student. Also, the data is stored in an excel file and it will be visualized.
# The purpose is to automate the distribution of digitally verifiable mark-sheets
# By use of this system the University or Schools will get the benefit and can produce the result of students with minimal error and in minimum time.
